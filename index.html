                        I'm fairly new to Python but I've found it very useful because of its simplicity.
                        I used it to program a backend in Flask for one of my projects.
                        It's libraries made it really appealing to do a web scraping project in it.

                        Java was the first language I learned. In my High school CS courses I learned
                        about variables, functions, data types and Object Oriented programming. I would
                        say I'm the most experienced with this language over others.

                        assignment. I recently came back to it so I could learn how to scrape html pages
                        off the web for my project. After that, I used it to create this site along with CSS!

                                    As a software engineer at Cisco, I was responsible for developing and maintaining
                                    software applications to support our products and services. I was part of a
                                    cross-functional development team that works on a service creation and delivery
                                    platform. My role involved a mix of software development, test automation, manual
                                    verification and debugging issues. For development I built features for our backend
                                    microservices in Golang and created automated tests for them in Python. Along with
                                    coding and testing, there was alot of collaboration involved to coordinate with
                                    teams on features that had external team dependencies. </p>

                    <h3 class="skill__title">Golang</h3>
                    <p class="skill__text">
                        One of my main goals for this work term was to learn Golang and its surrounding tools. This is
                        because Golang was becoming a prominent part of my team's software stack at Cisco. And
                        considering that the language's popularity has been growing in the backend development space, I
                        thought this would be a goal I could benefit from in the future. The first challenge I
                        encountered was wrapping my head around interfaces that weren't related to OOP. Another
                        challenge was dealing with errors without exception handling. Because of this, I had to learn to
                        check for errors returned by every function. After many months, I had grasped a better
                        understanding of these fundamental concepts of Go.

                    <h3 class="skill__title">REST APIs</h3>
                    <p class="skill__text">
                        Properly learning about REST APIs was another goal of mine. I wanted to learn what they were and
                        how to correctly implement them. The biggest reason behind this was that REST APIs are a
                        standardised protocol for communication in a client/server architecture. I thought this would
                        have major carry-over to other development co-ops I would do in the web/internet space. I
                        learned how to implement APIs such as GET, POST, DELETE, etc. Another thing I learned was when
                        to use query parameter vs path parameters when making a RESTful API call. Path params are to be
                        used when making a call specific to a resource, while query params specify properties of a
                        resource in the backend.

                    <h3 class="skill__title">Time Management</h3>
                    <p class="skill__text">
                        This goal was very important to me since I have always struggled with it in the past. Time
                        management is crucial in large software projects, because many things are being worked on
                        simultaneously. Vague requirements, internal dependencies, and deadlines are all problems that
                        get worse if you have bad time management. To work on this goal, I would clear up any vague
                        requirements right away when assigned a task. I would also scope out the problem ahead of time
                        to determine any external dependencies for finishing the task. I would work on those first to
                        make sure there aren't any unexpected delays in the completion of the task.

                                    During my time at Amazon, I spearheaded an intern project, where I was tasked
                                    with developing a web sandbox for a React Native UI library. This project aimed to
                                    provide internal customers with a platform to interact with and configure components
                                    in real-time. The primary languages leveraged for this project included
                                    TypeScript and React, and the project was hosted on AWS infrastructure. In addition
                                    to the development work, I conducted design reviews for my implementation, which

                        During my internship, a primary goal was gaining proficiency in React, crucial for my project
                        which involved building a web sandbox for a React Native UI library. Grappling with React's
                        component-based architecture and concepts like state management and props posed initial hurdles.
                        Immersing
                        myself in the React ecosystem, addressing challenges related to state management, component
                        composition, and routing became focal points. Seeking resources, engaging in pair programming
                        with teammates, and reading established React code bases helped me learn. Consistent
                        engagement with React-centric tasks, feedback incorporation, and active participation in the web

                        sandbox project. Navigating TypeScript's static typing paradigm was challenging,
                        requiring a shift from dynamic languages. Immersed in TypeScript, tackling complexities in type
                        handling, implementing interfaces for APIs, and integrating TypeScript with React components
                        became focal points. I sought out help from my teammates who had been experienced in TypeScript
                        longer than me to get up to speed. Consistent involvement in TypeScript-centric tasks, feedback
                        incorporation, and participation in the web sandbox project met requirements and equipped me
                        with valuable frontend development skills, especially in environments prioritizing strong

                        documentation, and modular code structures for maintainability. Actively engaging in code
                        reviews, seeking feedback, and incorporating industry best practices refined my approach.
                        Progressing, I incorporated principles like code modularity, encapsulation, and adhered to
                        design patterns. Recognizing the role of code documentation and self-explanatory code, I aimed
                        for functional and comprehensible contributions. My goal ended up having a good results as my

                                    While at Amazon, I had the pleasure to interact and learn from many people including
                                    developers, product owners, architects, and directors. But I would like to thank my
                                    manager Roi for guiding me and helping integrate into the team and Amazon as a
                                    whole.
